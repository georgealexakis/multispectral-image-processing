# Multispectral Image Processing
 
This project is the same implementation with [multispectral_processing](https://github.com/georgealexakis/multispectral_processing) out of ROS ecosystem. The whole project has been implemented with Python in a single python file. It contains all functions of [band separator](https://github.com/georgealexakis/multispectral_processing/blob/master/src/band_separator.py) as described in the origial repository including the feature-based registration and corner-based registration functions. Find out more about the project in my [Master Thesis](https://github.com/georgealexakis/multispectral-image-processing/blob/main/Georgios%20Alexakis%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf).
